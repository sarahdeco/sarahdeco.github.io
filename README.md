In 2021, I embarked on this journey to create my portfolio website. Since then, the site has undergone several name and branding changes to align with my evolving identity.

In this latest iteration, I transitioned my approach from a traditional artist to an interactive designer, emphasizing user-centric design. I hand-drafted the initial wireframes and meticulously refined the designs on Figma before coding the site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

After weeks of dedicated research and coding, I'm delighted to present the completed project. This website is more than a portfolio; it's an extension of myself. I aim for users to understand my personality, work ethic, and capabilities through an engaging digital experience.
