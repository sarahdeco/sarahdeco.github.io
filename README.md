In 2021, I embarked on a journey to create my portfolio website. Since then, the site has undergone several name and branding changes to align with my evolving identity.

In this latest iteration, I transitioned my approach from a traditional artist to an interactive designer, prioritizing user-centric design. I hand-drafted the initial wireframes and meticulously refined the designs on Figma before coding the site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and basic inlign JavaScript.

After weeks of dedicated self-directed research and coding, I'm delighted to present the completed project. This website is more than a portfolio; it's an extension of myself. I aim for users to understand my personality, work ethic, and capabilities through this engaging digital experience.
