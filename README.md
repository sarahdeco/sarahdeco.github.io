In 2021, I embarked on a journey to create my portfolio website. Since then, the site has undergone several name and branding changes to align with my evolving identity.

In this latest site iteration, I hand-drafted the low-fidelity wireframes and meticulously refined the designs on Figma before coding the site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and basic inline JavaScript. I plan to update the site as I learn new coding languages.

I am pleased to present the completed project. I aim for users to understand my personality and work ethic through this engaging digital experience.
